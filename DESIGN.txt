1. Logline for custom level: Mirrored Link and enemies
2. Logline for custom mechanic: Mirrored Link will always move opposite to the actual Link, and enemies can only be attacked by either mirrored or actual Link. Both Links share inventory, weapons and health.
3. Game players should plan movement for both Links, and makes it more difficult to attack enemies since enemies can only be attacked by one of the Links.
4. How to attack enemies with one link while keep the another Link safe in a shelter? Which Link should go first and attack?
5. A level introducing movement of mirrored Link. A level showing that enemies can only be attacked by one of the Links. After that, some really sophisticated levels that test the cooperation of the two Links.

* We decided to fix the weapons that are avaiable in the mirrored mode to reach the best difficulty. We want to have ranged attacks so we limit the weapons to arrows.
